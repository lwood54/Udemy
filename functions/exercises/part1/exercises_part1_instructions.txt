1. Write a function which takes an integer. The function will have two returns.
    The first return should be the argument divided by 2.
    The second return should be a bool that lets us know whether or not the
    argument was even. For example:
      a. half(1) returns (0, false)
      b. half(2) returns (1, true)

2. Modify the previous program to use a func expression.
  NOTE: Remember an expression has a value and is generally written horizontally.
        A statement is written vertically and can contain multiple expressions.
        (Kind of like a sentence vs a paragraph.)

3. Write a function with one variadic parameter that finds the greatest number
    in a list of numbers.

4. What's the value of the expression: (true&&false) || (false&&true) || !(false&&false)?

5. Write a function, foo, which can be called in all of these ways:
    func main() {
      foo(1, 2)
      foo(1, 2, 3)
      aSlice := []int{1,2,3,4}
      foo(aSlice...)
      foo()
    }
